# Dot-scripts
_Like dotfiles, but with extra bash_

This is a collection of scripts to perform post-installation tasks on a freshly installed Arch Linux system.  
That is, after having gone through the steps outlined in the [Installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide).

These scripts heavily borrow from the [Architect Installation Framework](https://github.com/CarlDuff/aif).  
For other related projects, see [Lution AIS](https://github.com/EvoLutionLinux/lution-ais)
and [Archlinux Ultimate Install](https://github.com/helmuthdu/aui).

**Warning**: These scripts are intended for personal use.  
If you run them on your system they might delete all your data, send rude emails to your coworkers,  
melt your hamster or -even worse- setup your computer the way _I_ like _my_ computer to be set up.
